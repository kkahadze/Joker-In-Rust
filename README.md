# Joker in Rust
## Introduction 
This is an implementation of the joker card game in Rust. I created this to practice coding in Rust while also as a programming challenge to see how difficult it may be to implement the difficult logic of the Joker card game into a low level language like Rust.
## What is Joker?
Joker is a card game commonly played in the country of Georgia and by some in Russia. It is not popular worldwide but has a lot of dedicated fans who even play
online on sites like [this](https://www.jok.ge). Joker is a card game played between four people in which each player must "call" how many hands they think they will take at the beginning of each set after a certain amount of cards are dealt to each user. After, each player must battle it out to see who can take the amount that they predicted they would. A more detailed description of the Joker card game can be found [here](https://www.pagat.com/exact/joker.html).
## Setup
To begin playing Joker through your command line, this is all you need to do:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kkahadze/joker.git && cd joker  
$ cargo build && cargo run
```
## Further Development
The need for an AI to play against would make it so four people are not needed to play which would make the game more fun, but also give us a look at what a Joker playing machine learning algorithm would look like. I plan to try to implement that in the future.
